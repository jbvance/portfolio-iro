Bloc Jams was the first project I worked on during my Time at Bloc. The purpose of the project was to develop a working music player in the browser. A fair amount of the design implementation was provided up front, and the primary focus of the project was to develop the functionality of the music player utilizing HTML and Javascript. Initially, I used vanilla Javascript to manipulate the DOM and interact with the page. Later, I refactored some of the code using jQuery. You can view the [jQuery version](https://github.com/jbvance/bloc-jams/) on Github.
